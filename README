utubeCLI
--------

is a great alternative to ugly and heavy YouTube browser interface.

Dependencies
------------

-mpv
-youtube-dl
-python3 
-python3-requests
 *This maybe works on python2 too, haven't tested that.
-and maybe something else

Originally utubeCLI uses mpv for playing files, but that can be easily changed to eg. mplayer

Using
-----

python3 /path/to/paa.py

Help with --help on startup or while using utubeCLI
